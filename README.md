# My-first-project
This project will mostly be me trying to learn more about programming, if you are interesed then be sure to stay and help me on the way if you feel like it. 

its been a few months since I last updated this, sorry btw anyway

I have been working on a game for the last few days now and i have been doing okay progress, I have one script atm for my games and the script I currently have is a playermovement script (i will leave it down in my github later) 

I set the camera as a child to my player so it follows the place and i made it look from top and down. I didnt know how i could make it work other then that, i just used about 3 or 4 days on finding a movement script but i ended up making a 3d platformer, I like if i could make 2D games instead but atm, I'm fine with this.
